# fitness-tracker

This is a fitness tracker for my PE Class. There was a massive cheating circle found (funny I know) of students bringing sharpies and markers to the field and illegitimately marking their cards as having done however many laps of the field for our fitness days.

This is a solution to that problem. The teacher scans his/her id card, and then scans the id cards of the student as he/she run by, and the web app keeps track of the laps he/she has done, and his/her total time. It is an elegant replacement of our previous method, as the students' id cards are no heavier or more inconvenient than the index cards they used to carry. Every student has an ID card so there is no discrepancy there either.
